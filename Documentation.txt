Compare YourSelf Serverless App Using AWS Services


1.Used Angular CLI Tool to setup environment and file structure.

2.Used AWS services in backend 

Used Amazon API Gateway service and it's cycle to create REST API with method's POST,DELETE,GET which get integrated in compare.services.ts file.

Used Lambda Services in Node.js to write buisness logic once the request reaches backend.

Used Dynamo DB No SQL database to store data model(.i.e User_id,Age,Height,Income)

Used Cognito service for user authentication and access of website ,which is integrated in aut.services.ts file.
Also used email OTP for confirming valid User.
We dont have to maintain user and password database while using Cognito.

Used Cloud storage service S3 to host the site on web with thw help of buckets.
First made the app optimised by ng-build command(which gives a dist folder) and then add content of dist folder in bucket.
